# Introduction

This project houses a function to clean transcripts from MS Teams by consolidating lines from the same speaker, removing blank lines, and removing short interjections from speaker B in between lines from speaker A. Use case is for private transcripts that cannot be shared, but at some point I will add examples to work with here.

Work in progress.
